## 💻 Project

verboo it's my version of the game [termooo](https://term.ooo/), it's simple but yet fun project to build, the list of words used in the games comes from the [pt-br lexicon](https://github.com/fserb/pt-br), which is now available under the MIT license.

Some differences from my version:
my version of the project the size of the board is variable according to the size of the word, as the name suggests the game chooses a verb for each game and you can play as many times as you want per day
